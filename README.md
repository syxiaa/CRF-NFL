What is CRF-NFL?
CRF-NFL is a libary for Complete Random Forest based Class Noise Filtering Learning methods. It is the first noise filtering learning framework that be able to be effectively combined into almost all kinds of classifiers and used in various data sets. It contains a collection of CRF-NFL based classifiers including CRF-NFL-E-kNNs, CRF-NFL-k means tree, CRF-NFL-BPNN, CRF-NFL-SVM, CRF-NFL-DT, CRF-NFL-LR and CRF-NFL-CNN. These classifiers are yielded by combining the CRF-NFL into the conventional classifiers. In addtion, this libary contains another most effective class noise detection algorithm, the Relative density for class noise detection.

CRF-NFL contains bindings for the following languages: MATLAB and Python.

News
♦ (14 October 2016) Version 1.0 is out bringing the CRF-NFL-E-kNNs, CRF-NFL-k means tree kNN, CRF-NFL-SVM and CRF-NFL-DT

♦ (16 June 2017) Version 2.0 is out bringing the CRF-NFL-LR, CRF-NFL-CNN, Parallel CRF and several other improvements.

♦ (18 October 2018) Version 3.0 is out bringing the CRF-NFL-GBDT and CRF-NFL-XGBoost. Besides, a test dataset is added as a new parameter of the learning functions besides a cross training set and cross validation set. In the former versions, only the validation accuracy is used to test the performence.
